"The Best Fashion Blogs Ever",,"Did you know that every 0.25 of a second, a fashion blog is launched somewhere in the world? 

Well, not strictly true (actually, it probably is – we just don’t have the scientific evidence). But it seems like it, non? 

Searching for online style inspiration, it’s easy to fall down the black hole of Insta-hell. When you finally look up from your phone, you realise you’ve spent two whole days scrolling through feeds in Korean - and you’re still in your dressing gown, with no idea what to wear (we’ve all been there). Which sort of defeats the point.

Well never fear, we’ve done the hard search for you. From our favourite UK blogs to the best missives from Milan and the coolest New Yorkers, read on for our definitive guide to the best-ever fashion blogs…
Man Repeller




Who: Fiercely funny New Yorker Leandra Medine.

Why: Of Turkish/Iranian Jewish descent, Medine kicked off her career with a blog called Boogers + Bagels. Her ironic fashion-addict asides soon had her readers rolling in the aisles, and she decided to focus on the topic full-time after a joky conversation while out shopping with a friend about how ‘man-repelling’ all the fashion-forward outfits they loved were. It’s now a male-scaring empire, providing in-depth intel: ‘The difference between Mom Jeans and Dad Jeans’, the fabulous ‘Manstagram’ – all the best fash items du jour – and fun features and style news aplenty.

She says: “I really see Man Repeller as an attitude and fashion as a language that we use to connect with other women.”

WishWishWish




Who: 24-year-old country girl Carrie Harwood, now based in London


Why: Lipstick lover Harwood's casual style has a super-cute retro tinge and we love her shoots in colourful locations - stripy all-in-one and heart shape sunnies in the fairground at Brighton Pier, anyone? We also like her fashiony travel section, documenting what she wears on her trips, everywhere from a friends' wedding in Norway to the Greek islands. 


She says: ""If you like cats, ‘60s dresses and junk food as much as I do, then we’ll get along just fine! I started up 5 years ago as a geeky 17 year old. I  always had an online diary of sorts (LiveJournal anyone?), so starting a blog was inevitable! I snap everything from fashion and food to London and cities across the world for the blog.""

<p>For the Nike Women's Training Spring 2012 collection, we asked Nike athletes and trainers to examine the way they train and look for the commonalities in their range of motion. Our designers then used innovation and design to develop a collection of footwear and apparel that enhances each one of the 6 CORE MOVES by providing zero distraction and technological details that are hidden in the beauty of a unique design aesthetic.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

<p>The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

<p>A flattering V-neck top that creates an elegant slimline silhouette. The Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix) hugs the body but also wicks sweat away from the skin keeping you cool, dry and comfortable. The positioning of the side seams keeps the top streamline and simple and the longer body not only elongates the look, but also keeps your rear covered when you Bend or Squat. Raglan sleeves allow arms and shoulders to move freely in moves such as the Pull while an underarm gusset and flat seam keep you comfortable. Tops come in an extensive range of block colors, with a subtle Nike swoosh on the breast. Attractive on its own, this slim-fit top is also great for layering with a jacket or team uniform.</p>

<p>For the Nike Women's Training Spring 2012 collection, we asked Nike athletes and trainers to examine the way they train and look for the commonalities in their range of motion. Our designers then used innovation and design to develop a collection of footwear and apparel that enhances each one of the 6 CORE MOVES by providing zero distraction and technological details that are hidden in the beauty of a unique design aesthetic.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment.

At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly.

<p>The main front body is made of soft Dri-FIT stretch jersey fabric (cotton, polyester and spandex mix) and the reverse of Dri-FIT mesh (polyester and spandex) for extra ventilation. The racer-style back is generously scooped out for fluid curves (picked out by the contrasting hem), slim straps and maximum freedom for the shoulders during moves such as push and pull as well as when rotating. A mesh back ventilation panel, in a contrasting color, accentuates the muscular lines of the bra.

<p>These eye-catching shorts consist of two layers, which work together for comfort, freedom of movement, and sweat management. The outer short is a Dri-FIT taffeta fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) that wicks sweat away to the surface of the short and dries quickly. This fabric also has a two-way stretch for an athletic fit and a side hem vent that keeps legs unrestricted when performing core moves such as the Lunge or Bend. The inner compression short and gusset is a soft Dri-FIT stretch-jersey fabric (polyester and spandex mix in a contrasting color) which wicks sweat away from the skin. Design features such as the elastic waistband and external drawcord ensure a snug, secure fit, lying flat on the body for a more flattering silhouette, while the flat seam construction reduces chaffing.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

<p>The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>The soft, cozy pre- and post-workout garment that will keep you comfortable during your warm up and cool down. Made from Dri-FIT single-knit, plated jersey fabric (a combination of organic cotton, recycled polyester and spandex), it wicks sweat away from your skin helping to keep you comfortable and warm. A cropped body, loose fit, open neckline, raglan sleeves, flat-seam construction (to reduce chaffing) and a gusset that runs all the way from the body to the sleeve hem allow for a full and free range of movement. But it&rsquo;s also fitted where needed, with a ribbed collar, waistband and cuffs maintaining a snug, efficient fit that won&rsquo;t leave it flapping about and getting in your way. A fashionable bleach-splattered design and color options that include blue, pink and soft grey alongside the traditional black, means it also looks great.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s made from a lightweight fabric blend with a ribbed texture and hugs the contours of the body, flattering your shape. An open mesh panel down the back provides an interesting design feature, but also allows ventilation and, for exercises such as yoga where correct posture is key, a window for the instructor to check alignment. In spite of its softness and lightness, it still offers support for a variety of low-impact gym activities with a hidden internal shelf bra. The longer length, sitting just below the hip, helps prevent the top from riding up, preserving your modesty and making you less self-conscious when performing squats and lunges or rotating.</p>

<p>The tight, seamless fit helps support the muscles and flatters the figure. At the back, the waistband is ribbed to keep it in place and tilted up for a natural fit helping to give you reassurance that you won&rsquo;t be exposed when bending and stretching. It also features a mesh panel for extra ventilation; this can also be used to help guide hip alignment, essential for exercises such as pilates. The lightweight fabric blend feels soft and luxurious but efficiently wicks sweat away from the skin during even a tough workout, helping to keep you dry and minimizing irritation. No seams also mean less chance of chaffing. A ribbed hem on the capris leg keeps it in place so you don&rsquo;t have to worry about distractions as you power your legs through a demanding workout.</p>

<p>The established Nike Pro apparel uses the Dri-FIT technology which wicks sweat away from the skin to the surface of the garment to help keep you dry and minimize irritation during tough workouts, and incorporates flat-seam construction to help reduce irritation caused by chaffing. For Spring 2012, the weight of the stretch jersey fabric (a polyester and spandex mix) has been increased to make it more robust allowing it to be worn as an outer layer as well as under team uniforms. The compression fit of the pants offers great support, with a secure elastic waistband and internal gusset for comfort. The range includes the 18.5 inch capris, funky 2.5-inch short print, bright and bold 5-inch short. These are complemented by the racer-style Nike Pro Bra, which offers freedom of movement while using its compression fit and nylon stabilizers in the bra straps to provide the level of support needed for a medium-impact training session that might involve running, and multidirectional movement.</p>

"Learning to Love Again",,"When I began the trail, I knew that I would miss the regular physical contact that I had with people in sedentary life. Everything from high fives, fist bumps, hugs, and handshakes – I would miss it all. Little did I know how strange and how hard it would be to feel love without that simple physical contact.
Disclaimer – you might want to read up on the 5 love languages if you’re slightly confused about what I am talking about. A simple Google search should suffice.
While on trail, besides ticks and bears, the thing that hikers fear most is Norovirus – imagine having a stomach bug for three days and not being able to eat anything while losing it all. Being a virus, it is spread through human contact with anyone or anything that is infected or has come into contact with it. For this reason, among others, you don’t shake hands, high five, fist bump, give hugs, and you make sure to actively avoid contact if possible.
Being someone who feels love through those simple interactions, it was so strange for me to not shake people’s hands when I met them or to congratulate people with hugs or high fives. It felt was as though I was being isolated from people even though I was in close proximity with them every day.
The good news is that physical contact isn’t the only love language. I found myself trying to love others and to be loved in ways that were not my primary languages. Whenever someone did trail magic, not only did I feel overjoyed, but there was a deeper sense of appreciation and gratitude that made me feel cared for and loved. If someone threw my bear line for me, I would feel the same thing – something deeper than service and gifts.
I see how the other love languages are more active in my life and think about how the trail isn’t just teaching my legs how to do big miles, or my brain to spend time in silence and though, but that it is changing me. It is changing the way that I can be loved and how I can adapt to be loved in almost every situation.

I can say that my second half of the hike was a lot more fun than the first half. Not going into town as often and not finding people that I really connected with. Do your best to find that early. Having this discussion with a fellow thru-hiker Lightning, we came to the conclusion that the thing we missed the most was the people. The kind of motivated, stubborn, people with a mission are hard to come by in the workplace. Getting a group of people together with a single mission, that won’t let the others fail, is not found in a lot of places.

"How SEO helps Tesco",,"Tesco is the clear winner in the online grocery market, in fact it takes almost 50p of every £1 spent on food shopping on the internet. 

This virtual monopoly is set to continue not just because of spending on fulfilment, dark stores, distribution, stock and offline marketing but due to its online visibility through organic search and a very visible well-structured website. 

Last week Graham Charlton of Econsultancy asked ""are supermarkets missing out on SEO opportunities?""

Yes is the easy answer for most, but across all food-stuff searches Tesco really is bucking the trend and hoovering up 50% of all online grocery spend.

But is Tesco really good or are the others really bad? 

What is the the online grocery market worth? 
Over 94% of all groceries are bought in bricks and mortar stores. For any other statistic like that there would be little fuss or even attention for the other 5-6%. 

However, the online grocery sector equates to £5.6bn (compared with the whole of the grocery market being worth £157bn). In terms of revenue, there is serious land grabbing to be had. 

The online share of the grocery market is minuscule compared to other sectors within retail.

Books, DVDs and music have long performed well online, perhaps partly due to the Amazon effect, and the relatively low brand loyalty to the store when purchasing such products.

For music and videos we purchase 80% of goods online as opposed to offline. The whole of online retail averages 11.7% of all sales in the UK.  ",1,how-seo-helps-tesco-to-dominate-the-online-grocery-market,"Scommerce Mage","Scommerce Mage",,"Tesco is the clear winner in the online grocery market, in fact it takes almost 50p of every £1 spent on food shopping on the internet. ",codazon_blog/codazon_blog_1472601575.jpg
"How do supermarkets use SEO",,"This of course is probably true for normal shoppers, (though may not be for bulk buyers such as restaurants, hotels, pubs or other caterers - who will shop for single product bargains).

However, we put an index of search terms together made up of all food stuffs and recipe ideas - it came to over 10m searches a month. Surely the supermarkets should be vying for that? 

It seems that some of the supermarkets are optimising for many, many food terms, and others are not.

Cause or correlation, but the ones that are placed for multiple food terms and recipes are the ones that are doing best online - i.e Tesco. 

Why does Tesco have 50% of the online grocery market? 
In terms of organic search, that is being found in Google’s search results, Tesco is extremely dominant.

I've created category specific indexes based on major search terms across the grocery sector eg frozen foods, online shopping, recipe ideas etc. The returning URLs for these keywords in Google’s search results are being tracked every day. 

As with the industry as a whole, Tesco is light-years ahead of the competition and it is no surprise that it has 50% of the ecommerce grocery market and is doing so well in the online shopping channel as its search positions dominate the sector. 

The example indexes are: 

General supermarket (search terms include: online shopping, groceries etc).
Mother and baby goods (baby milk, nappies etc). 
Fresh food and recipes (fresh pasta, fresh fruit, recipe ideas etc). 
Food cupboard (large marmite, pancake mix etc). 
Within these groups are around 2,500 search terms with a monthly search traffic, according to Google, of over 10m in the UK.

This data indicates that Tesco is by far the most visible supermarket. In fact all the other major supermarket brands hardly feature at all outside the general supermarket indexes. (all data from Pi Datametrics).

"How Shopping Saves Time, Money",,"Find A Grocery Delivery Service Near You

If you live in a major city, suburb, or other metro area, odds are there's a major national grocery chain near you that will deliver. Peapod is one of the larger national chains, and offers grocery delivery in major metro areas on the East Coast of the United States and most supermarkets owned by Royal Ahold. Safeway, North America's second largest supermarket chain, offers grocery delivery in markets nationwide under its own brand and the names of its subsidiary stores. If you don't have a Safeway in your area, you probably have a store that's part of the Safeway family, like Von's, Pavilions, and Genuardi's.

You don't have to rely on major supermarket chains though. Amazon Fresh supports markets in the Seattle metro area, Fresh Direct supports the New York City area, Schwan's offers an all-online subscription-style frozen food shopping and delivery service that supports most of the United States, ShopFoodEx also services all 50 US states, many countries around the world, and APO/FPO/DPO boxes worldwide, Netgrocer offers US and international grocery deliveries, and Amazon Grocery offers select items to customers anywhere in the US.

Check your local supermarket's web site to see if they offer a home delivery option—many let you sign up and shop online right on their web sites, others will hand you off to a third-party that manages the process for them. If none of the above cover you, odds are one of your local stores does.

How to Get Started with Your Local Delivery Service

While there's no one single service that supports everyone, most of them work just like any other online retailer. You'll need to sign up for an account, shop for your groceries, add items to your cart, and check out with your preferred credit or debit card. Just like when you buy a DVD at Amazon or music at iTunes, all of the standard tips to avoid fraud online and tips to avoid online scams apply when you're shopping at an online supermarket.

When you check out, the first thing you'll notice is the delivery charge, usually something like $5 or another specific fee based on the size of your order. Think of it as the equivalent to a shipping fee, and many grocery stores will waive the delivery fee entirely or give you a discount for your first order or your first repeat order. The last thing you'll need to do is schedule a delivery window when you know you'll be home to accept your food. When I order through Peapod, I can reschedule deliveries up to a few hours before the delivery window, so if I know I won't make it home in time for the doorbell, I can always bump out the delivery by a couple of hours.",1,how-shopping-saves-time-money,"Scommerce Mage","Scommerce Mage",,"Most of us hate going to the grocery store. Fighting for parking, dealing with the crowds, dodging shopping carts, waiting in long lines at checkout—they're all annoying and make us want to avoid the supermarket altogether",codazon_blog/codazon_blog_1472602740.jpg
"Buying Groceries Online",,"The things you generally don't want to trust a delivery service with until you get to know them are the types of products that require a subjective judge of quality before they go into your cart. Most delivery services keep their own stock separate from the grocery stores they partner with, and they only keep as much stock as they need for their deliveries. Even though their products are turned over and rotated more often than your supermarket shelves probably are, there are a few things you may want more personal control over.

Meat, deli meats, fish, seafood.
Unpackaged produce.
Some dairy products (eggs, gourmet cheese).
Perishable products and goods where you're not quite comfortable letting a stranger choose for you should stay off of your online shopping list until you're ready to test those waters. After all, there's no faster way to make sure you never order from a grocery delivery service than to order apples only to receive bruised, spotty fruit that you wouldn't have chosen had you actually gone to the store. The same applies for meat and seafood: if you're picky about the size and weight of the meat you buy, or how thickly your deli meats are sliced, you may have trouble giving up that control to an order picker who's responsible for filling a box with your order and putting it on the truck for delivery.

We're not saying you should never order these products from grocery delivery services. What we are saying is that you should probably hold off on them until you grow to know your delivery person, trust your delivery service, and fully understand your options to return products you're not happy with. In some cases, you may have to head into a grocery store to process an exchange. In other cases, you can just decline to accept that part of your order, and your delivery person will handle the exchange for you.

Still, if you know you'll never be happy unless you're the one squeezing the tomatoes in the produce section or you're a big fan of your local farmer's market or health food store, save the produce for a quick, personal trip, or beg a friend, neighbor, or family member to visit the store and choose wisely on your behalf. If the reason you're shopping for groceries online is because you'd rather put your time to better use, consider hiring a runner using a service like previously mentioned Fiverr to do the job for you.",1,what-to-avoid-when-buying-groceries-online,"Scommerce Mage","Scommerce Mage",,"The things you generally don't want to trust a delivery service with until you get to know them are the types of products that require a subjective judge of quality before they go into your cart.
